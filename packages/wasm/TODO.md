## TODOs

- [x] Include a map of rule name to ruleId in the module.
- [ ] Implicit space skipping
- [ ] Error handling
- [x] NonterminalNodes should keep track of the rule
- [ ] When iteration contains a sequence, the children are flattened into the iter node.
- [ ] Support direct left recursion.
- [ ] Separate API for _creating_ the Wasm module from the WasmMatcher interface.
- [ ] Implement a proper CLI.

## Limitations

- The input is assumed to be no bigger than 64k.
- For the memo table, we assume that there are no more than 256 rules in the grammar.

## Unanswered questions

- How to deal with matchLength in lookahead. In regular Ohm, lookahead _does_ bind things. But that is hard to square with the current CST representation, that stores only the matchLength. Because somehow the things inside a lookahead must consume nothing â€” but if you have `&("a" "b")`, the only way to make them consume nothing (in the current representation) is to rewrite the matchLength of the two terminal nodes.
  - Could we introduce a pseudo-node for lookahead? It could get transparently unpacked when walking the tree.
