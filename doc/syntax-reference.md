# Syntax Reference

This document describes the syntax of the _Ohm language_, which is a variant of parsing expression grammars (PEGs). If you have experience with PEGs, the Ohm syntax will mostly look familiar, but there are a few important differences to note:

- When naming rules, **case matters**: whitespace is implicitly skipped inside a rule application if the rule name begins with an uppercase letter. For further information, see [Syntactic vs. Lexical Rules](#syntactic-lexical).
- Grammars are purely about recognition: they do not contain semantic actions (those are defined separately) or bindings. The separation of semantic actions is one of the defining features of Ohm -- we believe that it improves modularity and makes both grammars and semantics easier to understand.
- Alternation expressions support _case names_, which are used in [inline rule declarations](#inline-rules). This makes semantic actions for alternation expressions simpler and less error-prone.
- Ohm does not (yet) support semantic predicates.

Ohm is closely related to [OMeta](http://tinlizzie.org/ometa/), another PEG-based language for parsing and pattern matching. Like OMeta, Ohm supports a few features not supported by many PEG parsing frameworks:

- [Rule applications](#rule-application) can accept parameters. This makes it possible to write higher-order rules, such as the built-in `ListOf` rule.
- Grammars can be extended in an object-oriented way -- see [Defining, Extending, and Overriding Rules](#defining-extending-and-overriding-rules).

## Terminology

<!-- @markscript
  const ohm = require('ohm-js');
  function checkGrammar(source) {
  	assert(ohm.grammar(source));
  }
  markscript.transformNextBlock(checkGrammar);
-->

```
Arithmetic {
  Expr = "1 + 1"
}
```

This is a grammar named "Arithmetic", which has a single rule named "Expr". The right hand side of _Expr_ is known as a "rule body". A rule body may be any valid _parsing expression_.

## Parsing Expressions

Here is a full list of the different kinds of parsing expressions supported by Ohm:

### Terminals

    "hello there"

Matches exactly the characters contained inside the quotation marks.

#### Special characters

Special characters (`"`, `\`, and `'`) can be escaped with a backslash -- e.g., `"\""` will match a literal quote character in the input stream. Other valid escape sequences include: `\b` (backspace), `\f` (form feed), `\n` (line feed), `\r` (carriage return), and `\t` (tab), as well as `\x` followed by 2 hex digits and `\u` followed by 4 hex digits, for matching characters by code point.

The <code>\u{<i>hexDigits<i>}</code> escape sequence can be used to represent _any_ Unicode code point, including code points above `0xFFFF`. E.g., `"\u{1F639}"` will match `'ðŸ˜¹'`. (_New in Ohm v16.3.0._)

**NOTE:** For grammars defined in a JavaScript string literal (i.e., not in a separate .ohm file), it's recommended to use a [template literal with the String.raw tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/raw). Without `String.raw`, you'll need to use double-escaping -- e.g., `\\n` rather than `\n`.

### Terminal Range

<pre><code><i>start</i>..<i>end</i></code></pre>

Matches exactly one code point whose value is between _start_ and _end_ (inclusive). E.g., `"a".."c"` will match `'a'`, `'b'`, or `'c'`. Note: _start_ and _end_ must be [Terminal](#terminals) expressions containing a single character or code point. (_Note:_ Prior to Ohm v16.3.0, terminal ranges only supported code points up `0xFFFF`. As of v16.3.0, higher code points can be specified directly (e.g. `"ðŸ˜‡".."ðŸ˜ˆ"`) or with an escape code (`"\u{1F607}".."\u{1F608}"`).

<!-- @markscript
  assert(ohm.grammar('G{ start = "ðŸ˜‡".."ðŸ˜ˆ" }').match('ðŸ˜‡').succeeded())
  assert(ohm.grammar('G{ start = "\u{1F607}".."\u{1F608}" }').match('ðŸ˜‡').succeeded())
-->

### Rule Application

<pre><code><i>ruleName</i></code></pre>

Matches the body of the rule named _ruleName_. For example, the built-in rule `letter` will parse a string of length 1 that is a letter.

<pre><code><i>ruleName</i>&lt;<i>expr</i>&gt;</code></pre>

Matches the body of the _parameterized rule_ named _ruleName_, substituting the parsing expression _expr_ as its first parameter. For parameterized rules with more than one parameter, the parameters are comma-separated, e.g. `ListOf<field, ";">`.

### Repetition operators: \*, +, ?

<pre><code><i>expr</i> *</code></pre>

Matches the expression _expr_ repeated 0 or more times. E.g., `"a"*` will match `''`, `'a'`, `'aa'`, ...

Inside a _syntactic rule_ -- any rule whose name begins with an upper-case letter -- spaces before a match are automatically skipped. E.g., `"a"*` will match `" a a"` as well as `"aa"`. See the documentation on [syntactic and lexical rules](#syntactic-lexical) for more information.

<pre><code><i>expr</i> +</code></pre>

Matches the expression _expr_ repeated 1 or more times. E.g., `letter+` will match `'x'`, `'xA'`, ...

As with the `*` operator, spaces are skipped when used in a [syntactic rule](#syntactic-lexical).

<pre><code><i>expr</i> ?</code></pre>

Tries to match the expression _expr_, succeeding whether it matches or not. No input is consumed if it does not match.

### Sequence

<pre><code><i>expr1</i> <i>expr2</i></code></pre>

Matches the expression `expr1` followed by `expr2`. E.g., `"grade" letter` will match `'gradeA'`, `'gradeB'`, ...

As with the `*` and `+` operators, spaces are skipped when used in a [syntactic rule](#syntactic-lexical). E.g., `"grade" letter` will match `' grade A'` as well as `'gradeA'`.

### Alternation

<pre><code><i>expr1</i> | <i>expr2</i></code></pre>

Matches the expression `expr1`, and if that does not succeed, matches the expression `expr2`. E.g., `letter | digit` will match `'a'`, `'9'`, ...

### Lookahead: &

<pre><code>& <i>expr</i></code></pre>

Succeeds if the expression `expr` can be matched, but does not consume anything from the input stream. Usually used as part of a sequence, e.g. `letter &digit` will match `'a9'`, but only consume 'a'. `&"a" letter+` will match any string of letters that begins with 'a'.

### Negative Lookahead: ~

<pre><code>~ <i>expr</i></code></pre>

Succeeds if the expression `expr` cannot be matched, and does not consume anything from the input stream. Usually used as part of a sequence, e.g., `~"\n" any` will consume any single character that is not a new line character.

### Lexification: <span>#</span>

<pre><code># <i>expr</i></code></pre>

Matches _expr_ as if in a lexical context. This can be used to prevent whitespace skipping before an expression that appears in the body of a syntactic rule. For further information, see [Syntactic vs. Lexical Rules](#syntactic-lexical).

### Comment

Inside an Ohm grammar, you can use both single-line (`//`) comments like

```
booleanLiteral = ("true" | "false") // TODO: Should we support "True"/"False" as well?
```

or

```
// For semantics on how decimal literals are constructed, see section 7.8.3
```

as well as multiline (`/* */`) comments like:

```
/*
  Note: Punctuator and DivPunctuator (see https://es5.github.io/x7.html#x7.7) are
  not currently used by this grammar.
*/
```

## Built-in Rules

(See [src/built-in-rules.ohm](../src/built-in-rules.ohm).)

`any`: Matches the next character in the input stream, if one exists.

`letter`: Matches a single character which is a letter (either uppercase or lowercase).

`lower`: Matches a single lowercase letter.

`upper`: Matches a single uppercase letter.

`digit`: Matches a single character which is a digit from 0 to 9.

`hexDigit`: Matches a single character which is a either digit or a letter from A-F.

`alnum`: Matches a single letter or digit; equivalent to `letter | digit`.

`space`: Matches a single whitespace character (e.g., space, tab, newline, etc.)

`end`: Matches the end of the input stream. Equivalent to `~any`.

<code>caseInsensitive&lt;<i>terminal</i>&gt;</code>: Matches _terminal_, but ignoring any differences in casing (based on the simple, single-character Unicode case mappings). E.g., `caseInsensitive<"ohm">` will match `'Ohm'`, `'OHM'`, etc.

<code>ListOf&lt;<i>elem</i>, <i>sep</i>&gt;</code>: Matches the expression _elem_ zero or more times, separated by something that matches the expression _sep_. E.g., `ListOf<letter, ",">` will match `''`, `'a'`, and `'a, b, c'`.

<code>NonemptyListOf&lt;<i>elem</i>, <i>sep</i>&gt;</code>: Like `ListOf`, but matches _elem_ at least one time.

<code>listOf&lt;<i>elem</i>, <i>sep</i>&gt;</code>: Similar to `ListOf<elem, sep>` but interpreted as [lexical rule](#syntactic-lexical).

<code id="applySyntactic">applySyntactic&lt;<i>ruleName</i>&gt;</code>: Allows the syntactic rule _ruleName_ to be applied in a lexical context, which is otherwise not allowed. Spaces are skipped _before_ and _after_ the rule application. _New in Ohm v16.1.0._

## Grammar Syntax

### Grammar Inheritance

<pre><code><i>grammarName</i> &lt;: <i>supergrammarName</i> { ... }</code></pre>

Declares a grammar named `grammarName` which inherits from `supergrammarName`.

### Defining, Extending, and Overriding Rules

In the three forms below, the rule body may optionally begin with a `|` character, which will be
ignored. Also note that in rule names, [**case is significant**](#syntactic-lexical).

<pre><code><i>ruleName</i> = <i>expr</i></code></pre>

Defines a new rule named `ruleName` in the grammar, with the parsing expression `expr` as the rule body. Throws an error if a rule with that name already exists in the grammar or one of its supergrammars.

<pre><code><i>ruleName</i> := <i>expr</i></code></pre>

Defines a rule named `ruleName`, overriding a rule of the same name in a supergrammar. Throws an error if no rule with that name exists in a supergrammar.

**New in 15.3.0:** The _super-splice_ operator (`...`) can be used to append and/or prepend cases to the supergrammar rule body. E.g., if the supergrammar defines `comment = multiLineComment`, then `comment := ... | singleLineComment` is equivalent to `comment := multiLineComment | singleLineComment`.

<pre><code><i>ruleName</i> += <i>expr</i></code></pre>

Extends a supergrammar rule named `ruleName`, throwing an error if no rule with that name exists in a supergrammar. The rule body will effectively be <code><i>expr</i> | <i>oldBody</i></code>, where `oldBody` is the rule body as defined in the supergrammar.

Note that as of v15.3.0, the super-splice operator (`...`) offers a more general form of rule extension. E.g., `keyword += "def"` can also be written `keyword := "def" | ...`.

#### Parameterized Rules

<pre><code><i>ruleName</i>&lt;<i>arg1</i>, ..., <i>argN</i>&gt; = <i>expr</i></code></pre>

Defines a new rule named `ruleName` which has _n_ parameters. In the rule body _expr_, the parameter names (e.g. _arg1_) may be used as rule applications. E.g., `Repeat<x> = x x`.

#### Rule Descriptions

Rule declarations may optionally have a description, which is a parenthesized "comment" following the name of the rule in its declaration. Rule descriptions are used to produce better error messages for end users of a language when input is not recognized. For example:

<!-- @markscript
  function checkRule(source) {
    assert(ohm.ohmGrammar.match(source, 'Rule').succeeded());
  }
  markscript.transformNextBlock(checkRule);
-->

```
ident (an identifier)
  = ~keyword name
```

#### Inline Rule Declarations

<pre><code><i>expr</i> -- <i>caseName</i></code></pre>

When a parsing expression is followed by the characters `--` and a name, it signals an _inline rule declaration_. This is most commonly used in alternation expressions to ensure that each branch has the same arity. For example, the following declaration:

<!-- @markscript
  markscript.transformNextBlock(checkRule);
-->

```
AddExp = AddExp "+" MulExp  -- plus
       | MulExp
```

is equivalent to:

```ohm
AddExp = AddExp_plus
       | MulExp
AddExp_plus = AddExp "+" MulExp
```

<h3 id="syntactic-lexical">Syntactic vs. Lexical Rules</h3>

<!-- https://git.io/JiYgP -->

A _syntactic rule_ is a rule whose name begins with an uppercase letter, and _lexical rule_ is one whose name begins with a lowercase letter. The difference between lexical and syntactic rules is that syntactic rules implicitly skip whitespace characters.

The definition of "whitespace character" is anything that matches the grammar's `space` rule. The default implementation of `space` matches ' ', '\t', '\n', '\r', and any other character that is considered whitespace in the [ES5 spec](http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-7.2).

#### How space skipping works

In the body of a syntactic rule, Ohm implicity inserts applications of the `spaces` rule before each expression. (The `spaces` rule is defined as `spaces = space*`.) As an example, take this fragment of JSON grammar:

<!-- @markscript
  let syntacticDefs;
  markscript.transformNextBlock(code => {
    syntacticDefs = code;
  });
-->

```
Array = "[" "]"  -- empty
      | "[" Elements "]"  -- nonEmpty
Elements = Element ("," Element)*
```

`Array` and `Elements` are both synactic rules, since their names begin with a capital letter. Here's what a lexical version of these rule would look like, with _explicit_ space skipping:

<!-- @markscript
  let lexicalDefs;

  const delexifyRuleNames = str =>
    str.replace(/array/g, 'Array').replace(/element/g, 'Element');

  markscript.transformNextBlock(code => {
    lexicalDefs = code;
    assert.equal(syntacticDefs, delexifyRuleNames(lexicalDefs).replace(/spaces /g, ''));

    const g = ohm.grammar(`
      JSON {
        ${syntacticDefs}
        ${lexicalDefs}
        lexStart = array spaces  // Ensure trailing space is skipped.
        Element = number
        element = number
        number = digit+
      }
    `);
    assert(g.match(' [2, 33 ] ').succeeded());
    assert(g.match(' [2, 33 ] ', 'lexStart').succeeded());

    assert(g.match(' [ ] ').succeeded());
    assert(g.match(' [ ] ', 'lexStart').succeeded());

    assert(g.match('[]  ').succeeded());
    assert(g.match('[]  ', 'lexStart').succeeded());

    assert(g.match(' [12 ,2,2]').succeeded());
    assert(g.match(' [12 ,2,2]', 'lexStart').succeeded());

    assert(g.match(' [1 2]').failed());
    assert(g.match(' [1 2]', 'lexStart').failed());

    assert(g.match(' [1,]').failed());
    assert(g.match(' [1,]', 'lexStart').failed());
  });
-->

```
array = spaces "[" spaces "]"  -- empty
      | spaces "[" spaces elements spaces "]"  -- nonEmpty
elements = spaces element (spaces "," spaces element)*
```

In terms of the language it accepts, this version of the rules â€” with explicit space skipping â€” is equivalent to the syntactic version above.

A few other details that are helpful to know:

1. If the start rule is a syntactic rule, both leading and trailing spaces are skipped around the top-level application.
2. When the body of a rule contains a [repetition operator](#repetition-operators---) (e.g. `+` or `*`), spaces are skipped before each match. In other words, `Names = name+` is equivalent to `names = (spaces name)+`.
3. The [lexification operator (`#`)](lexification-) can be used in the body of a syntactic rule to prevent space skipping in specific places. For example:

<!-- @markscript
  let syntacticKeyValueDef;
  markscript.transformNextBlock(code => { syntacticKeyValueDef = code; });
-->

```
KeyAndValue = #(letter alnum+) ":" #(digit+)
```

is equivalent to:

<!-- @markscript
  markscript.transformNextBlock(code => {
    let lexicalKeyValueDef = code;

    const g = ohm.grammar(`G { ${syntacticKeyValueDef} ${lexicalKeyValueDef} }`);
    assert(g.match('count :33', 'keyAndValue').succeeded());
    assert(g.match('count :33', 'KeyAndValue').succeeded());
    assert(g.match('count: 33', 'keyAndValue').failed());
    assert(g.match('count: 33', 'KeyAndValue').failed());
  });
-->

```
keyAndValue = letter alnum+ spaces ":" digit+
```

Note that no space skipping occurs _inside_ or _before_ the lexical context defined by the `#` character. That means that this rule will match `'count :33'`, but _not_ `'count: 33'`.
