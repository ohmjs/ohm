Ohm is a parsing toolkit consisting of a library and a domain-specific language. You can use it to parse custom file formats or quickly build parsers, interpreters, and compilers for programming languages.

The _Ohm language_ is based on [parsing expression grammars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar)
(PEGs), which are a formal way of describing syntax, similar to regular expressions and context-free
grammars. The _Ohm library_ provides a JavaScript interface for creating parsers, interpreters, and
more from the grammars you write.

- **Full support for left-recursive rules** means that you can define left-associative operators in a natural way.
- **Object-oriented grammar extension** makes it easy to extend an existing language with new syntax.
- **Modular semantic actions.** Unlike many similar tools, Ohm completely
  separates grammars from semantic actions. This separation improves modularity and extensibility, and makes both grammars and semantic actions easier to read and understand.
- **Online editor and visualizer.** The [Ohm Editor](https://ohmlang.github.io/editor/) provides instant feedback and an [interactive visualization](https://dubroy.com/blog/visualizing-packrat-parsing/) that makes the entire execution of the parser visible and tangible. It'll [make you feel like you have superpowers](https://twitter.com/kylestetz/status/1349770893120172036). ðŸ’ª

Some awesome things people have built using Ohm:

- [Seymour](https://harc.github.io/seymour-live2017/), a live programming environment for the classroom.
- [Shadama](https://tinlizzie.org/~ohshima/shadama2/live2017/), a particle simulation language designed for high-school science.
- [turtle.audio](http://turtle.audio/), an audio environment where simple text commands generate lines that can play music.
- A [browser-based tool](https://www.arthurcarabott.com/konnakkol/) that turns written _Konnakkol_ (a South Indian vocal percussion art) into audio.
- [Wildcard](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/wildcard/), a browser extension that empowers anyone to modify websites to meet their own specific needs, uses Ohm for its spreadsheet formulas.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with Ohm is to use the [interactive editor](https://ohmlang.github.io/editor/). Alternatively, you can play with one of the following examples on JSFiddle:

### Installation

For use in the browser:

- Download [ohm.js](https://unpkg.com/ohm-js@latest/dist/ohm.js) (development version, with full source and comments) or [ohm.min.js](https://unpkg.com/ohm-js@latest/dist/ohm.min.js) (a minified version for faster page loads).
- Add a new script tag to your page, and set the `src` attribute to the path of the file you just downloaded. E.g.:

  ```html
  <script src="ohm.js"></script>
  ```

  This creates a global variable named `ohm`.

If you are using Node.js, you can just install the `ohm-js` package using [npm](http://npmjs.org):

    npm install ohm-js

This will install Ohm in the local node_modules folder. Use `require` to access it from a Node script:

<!-- @markscript
  markscript.transformNextBlock(s => s.replace('const ', 'var '));
-->

```js
const ohm = require('ohm-js');
```

### Basics

#### Defining Grammars

![Instantiating a grammar](http://harc.github.io//ohm/doc/images/instantiating-grammars.png)

To use Ohm, you need a grammar that is written in the Ohm language. The grammar provides a formal
definition of the language or data format that you want to parse. There are a few different ways
you can define an Ohm grammar:

- The simplest option is to define the grammar directly in a JavaScript string and instantiate it
  using `ohm.grammar()`. In most cases, you should use a [template literal with String.raw](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/raw):

  ```js
  const myGrammar = ohm.grammar(String.raw`
    MyGrammar {
      greeting = "Hello" | "Hola"
    }
  `);
  ```

- **In Node.js**, you can define the grammar in a separate file, and read the file's contents and instantiate it using `ohm.grammar(contents)`:

  In `myGrammar.ohm`:

        MyGrammar {
          greeting = "Hello" | "Hola"
        }

  In JavaScript:

  ```js
  const fs = require('fs');
  const ohm = require('ohm-js');
  const contents = fs.readFileSync('myGrammar.ohm', 'utf-8');
  const myGrammar = ohm.grammar(contents);
  ```

For more information, see [Instantiating Grammars](doc/api-reference.md#instantiating-grammars) in the API reference.

#### Using Grammars

![Matching input](http://harc.github.io/ohm/doc/images/matching.png)

<!-- @markscript
  // The duplication here is required because Markscript only executes top-level code blocks.
  // TODO: Consider fixing this in Markscript.
  const myGrammar = ohm.grammar('MyGrammar { greeting = "Hello" | "Hola" }');
-->

Once you've instantiated a grammar object, use the grammar's `match()` method to recognize input:

```js
const userInput = 'Hello';
const m = myGrammar.match(userInput);
if (m.succeeded()) {
  console.log('Greetings, human.');
} else {
  console.log("That's not a greeting!");
}
```

The result is a MatchResult object. You can use the `succeeded()` and `failed()` methods to see whether the input was recognized or not.

For more information, see the [main documentation](doc/README.md).

### Debugging

Ohm has two tools to help you debug grammars: a text trace, and a graphical visualizer.

[![Ohm Visualizer](http://harc.github.io/ohm/doc/images/visualizer-small.png)](https://ohmlang.github.io/editor)

You can [try the visualizer online](https://ohmlang.github.io/editor).

To see the text trace for a grammar `g`, just use the [`g.trace()`](./doc/api-reference.md#trace)
method instead of `g.match`. It takes the same arguments, but instead of returning a MatchResult
object, it returns a Trace object â€” calling its `toString` method returns a string describing
all of the decisions the parser made when trying to match the input. For example, here is the
result of `g.trace('ab').toString()` for the grammar `G { start = letter+ }`:

<!-- @markscript
  markscript.transformNextBlock(function(code) {
    const trace = ohm.grammar('G { start = letter+ }').trace('ab');
    assert.equal(trace.toString().trim(), code.trim());
  });
-->

```
ab         âœ“ start â‡’  "ab"
ab           âœ“ letter+ â‡’  "ab"
ab             âœ“ letter â‡’  "a"
ab                 âœ“ lower â‡’  "a"
ab                   âœ“ Unicode [Ll] character â‡’  "a"
b              âœ“ letter â‡’  "b"
b                  âœ“ lower â‡’  "b"
b                    âœ“ Unicode [Ll] character â‡’  "b"
               âœ— letter
                   âœ— lower
                     âœ— Unicode [Ll] character
                   âœ— upper
                     âœ— Unicode [Lu] character
                   âœ— unicodeLtmo
                     âœ— Unicode [Ltmo] character
           âœ“ end â‡’  ""
```

## Publishing Grammars

If you've written an Ohm grammar that you'd like to share with others, see
our [suggestions for publishing grammars](./doc/publishing-grammars.md).

## Contributing to Ohm

All you need to get started:

    git clone https://github.com/harc/ohm.git
    cd ohm
    npm install

**NOTE:** We recommend using the latest Node.js stable release.

### Some useful scripts

- `npm test` runs the unit tests.
- `npm run test-watch` re-runs the unit tests every time a file changes.
- `npm run build` builds [dist/ohm.js](./dist/ohm.js) and [dist/ohm.min.js](./dist/ohm.min.js),
  which are stand-alone bundles that can be included in a webpage.
- When editing Ohm's own grammar (in `src/ohm-grammar.ohm`), run `npm run bootstrap` to re-build Ohm
  and test your changes.

Before submitting a pull request, be sure to add tests, and ensure that `npm run prepublish` runs
without errors.
